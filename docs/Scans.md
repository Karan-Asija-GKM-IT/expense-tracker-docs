# Scans & Test Coverage

## SAST Scan 

SAST (Static Application Security Testing) scan is a method of analyzing an application's source, binary, or bytecode to find security vulnerabilities before the code is executed.

## DAST Scan 

A DAST (dynamic application security testing) scan uses black-box testing to find vulnerabilities in a running application by simulating attacks from the outside in, much like a malicious user would. It sends requests to the application and analyzes the responses for unexpected results, identifying security flaws that other testing methods, like analyzing static code, might miss. DAST scans are independent of the application's source code and programming language, making them applicable to a wide range of deployed applications.
